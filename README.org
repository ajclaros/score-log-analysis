* Installing, setting up python
- [[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual][Install anaconda]]
- Open anaconda prompt (search for the installed program)
- within the command line type "conda create -n analysis python=3.8 numpy matplotlib pandas graphviz graphviz-python spyder

* Running and editing scripts
- Download this repository and unzip
- Refer to the folder structure of the repository for your project, replace the folders named "blue" and "yellow" with your group names, place score logs in their respective groups
- After opening the anaconda prompt type "conda activate analysis", a new prompt with (analysis) should appear, then type "spyder" which opens the spyder IDE
** create_dfs.py
- Within Spyder, open "create_dfs.py"
*** Editing file:
- Line 20: Replace "blue" with your group name
- Line 21: Replace "dyad" with your folder name
**** Editing duplicated behaviors:
- If you don't have duplicate behaviors, you can skip this
- Sometimes behaviors that are meant to be the same have slightly different names- different capitalizing or spacing, and you'd like to combine them
- Modify line 44: 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
df[i]['Behavior'] = np.where(df[i]['Behavior'].isin(['Entry/Exit Pot', 'Entry /Exit Pot']), 'Pot', df[i]['Behavior'])
#+END_SRC
- Change ['Entry/Exit Pot', 'Entry /Exit Pot'] in a form similar to ['behavior_1', 'Behavior 1', 'behavior1'] as behaviors you'd like to combine
- replace 'Pot' with the behavior with the name you'd like to replace with
- It should look similar to the form:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
df[i]['Behavior'] = np.where(df[i]['Behavior'].isin(['behavior_1', 'Behavior 1', 'behavior1']), 'Behavior_1', df[i]['Behavior'])
#+END_SRC 
- add more simliar lines for other behvaiors you'd like to combine

**** Editing for behavior classes:
- edit lines 49, 50, 51, or adding/removing lines according to how many behavior classes there are
- Using line 59 as a template:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
df[i]['Behavioral category'] = np.where(df[i]['Behavior'].isin(['flee']), 'Aversive', df[i]['Behavioral category'])
#+END_SRC
- Replace ['flee'] with a list of behaviors for a given class, replace "Aversive" with the behvaior class
**** Running file
- Run program by pressing green arrow at top of screen or pressing F5
- Line 20: replace with the second group name
- A new folder should appear within each of your group folders titled "converted_data" with four .csv files titled "behavior_time", "behavior_time_probabilities", "transition_df" and "transition_probabilities"
** markov_boris.py
- open markov_boris.py within spyder
- Line 11: replace with your group name
- Line 12: replace with folder name
- Run file

** barplots.py
- lines 10, 11: replace "blue" and "yellow" with the respective group names
- Line 40: replace "blue", "gold" with your choice of color for bar plots
