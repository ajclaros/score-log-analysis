* Description
- creates folders for each animal type
- summarizes score logs for each animal type
- creates markov chain graphs for each file in folder and thier average
- creates single bar plot to of time spent in each behavior for all animal types
* Installing, setting up python
- [[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual][Install anaconda]]
- Open anaconda prompt (search for the installed program)
- within the command line type "conda create -n analysis python=3.8 numpy matplotlib pandas graphviz python-graphviz spyder"

* Running and editing scripts
- Download this repository and unzip the folder
- Place all score logs into the 'data' folder

- After opening the anaconda prompt type "conda activate analysis", a new prompt with (analysis) should appear, then type "spyder" which opens the spyder IDE
- optional: test run the installation by running the scripts on the files in this folder
** analysis.py
- Within Spyder, open the file within the analysis folder: "analysis.py"
*** Editing file:
- lines 20 through 24: Replace behavior classes with your own behavior classes (if different from file), and their colors when representing in graphs
- replace line 27 with the colors for each bar graph
**** Editing duplicated behaviors:
- If you don't have duplicate behaviors, you can skip this
- use line 38 as a template to combine differently spelled behaviors

**** Raster dimensions
- Lines 46 and 47 change the raster plot dimensions, change if you'd like to change the original dimensions
- If you'd rather not have raster plots, you can comment out lines 378 to 382 with a "#" at the beginnning

**** Editing for behavior classes:
- For each behavior classification in your dataset add a color associated with each behavior class such as "Aggressive":"red" to lines 20 through 22, add or remove line depending on your dataset
- Modify Line 25 for bar colors. "Subordinate": "Blue" means that the animal type "Subordinate" will be displayed as a blue color in the bar charts. 
- modify lines 30 through 34 for behavior classes and their associated behaviors
- add more behavior classes in a similar format

**** Raster plots
- Line 42: Add in behaviors of interest to create raster plots. For current data it is ['b peck', 'y peck','y flee','b flee','b circle','y circle','y follow', 'b follow', 'enter']
**** Running file
- Run program by pressing green arrow at top of screen or pressing F5
